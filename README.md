# About
This is a Matlab program that, with the use of a laptop webcam, can perform simple operations using only hand gestures. 

For example, first the user shows the amount of fingers of the first operand (3 fingers for example), then the user should indicate the operator (for example a horizontal cross, for a plus sign) and finally show the second operand (2 fingers for example). By continuation, the program will output the result of such operation (in this case: 2 + 3 = 5). This kind of project could be applied in medical settings with strict hygienic requirements. In addition, it can be applied for speech and hearing impaired users, and provide them with a more natural interface.


In this project, we apply a simplified model, just for making mathematical operations. But this idea could be expanded to more complex systems understanding sign language.
